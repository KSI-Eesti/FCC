        Remember the last time you visited         a hospital. What was your                   experience? 

        You probably registered for the             appointment beforehand, called your         name, the problem you have, and the         receptionist booked you an                 appointment. Or you simply booked           it online through the website. No           matter what the flow was, hospitals         asked for some personal info like           name, phone number, address,               insurance, etc. 

        Why do they request all these               details, and where do they keep             them? The answer is – hospital             management system. 
         <br>
         <br>
        A hospital management system (HMS)         is a tool that collects data about         patients, doctors, staff, hospital         administrative details in one               software. One of the biggest               advantages of the hospital                 management system is that it makes         the whole process paperless.
